This is an open-ended homework assignment to assess your skills as a software engineer. You can complete it at your leisure, but don't loose sleep or a weekend over it. And most importantly, don't worry about it being unfinished.

## Are you sitting comfortably? Then let's begin.

You will be creating a data visualisation tool that displays a git commit history; you can visualise the data along any dimension in any shape or form. For this particular task, use the very friendly and well-documented [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/). We leave it up to you to pick a repository you want to work with.

Generally, there are no restrictions on libraries and tools you're allowed to use. Heck, you can even rip up this beautiful scaffolding and start anew, but bare in mind that **React, Redux** and **Redux-Saga** are mandatory. Well then, good luck, and may God speed you! ✌️

### What are we looking for:

- Ability to write clean and well-structured code
- Ability to understand, extend, and improve the existing code
- Ability to read and understand documentation
- Proficiency in React and Redux patterns
- Good software development practices
- Good UI

### Bonus points:

- Surprise us

## How to begin

- Fork the repository
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to start the dev server

## How to submit

- Open a PR into this repo.
